# 🚀 BERT 2D Imager - START HERE

## 📍 Where You Are Now

You have a **fully functional BERT 2D Imager application** running in the Emergent development environment.

**✅ What's Working:**
- Backend with real PyGimli integration code
- Frontend with professional 4-tab interface
- File upload, parsing, QA/QC, and inversion
- All APIs tested and functional

**⚠️ Current Limitation:**
- Using **mock PyGimli** (generates synthetic, non-scientific plots)
- Real PyGimli needs conda (not available in this container)

**📊 Evidence:**
- You tested with multiple STG files
- Plots all look similar (expected with mock)
- Need real PyGimli for accurate research results

---

## 🎯 Your Goal

Get **real PyGimli** working so inversions are scientifically accurate for your research.

## 🛣️ Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Deploy to Your Windows 11 PC (FASTEST) ⚡

**Timeline:** 2 hours to setup, then continue developing

**Why this works:**
- ✅ You already have conda installed
- ✅ PyGimli installs easily via conda-forge
- ✅ Use VSCodium (your preferred IDE)
- ✅ Get real results TODAY

**What you need:**
1. Transfer application to Windows
2. Create conda environment
3. Install PyGimli
4. Start developing with real data

**📖 Instructions:**
1. Read: `TRANSFER_TO_WINDOWS.md` (how to get files)
2. Follow: `WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` (complete setup)
3. Reference: `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` (quick commands)

**Next Action:** Download the application files from Emergent

---

### Path 2: Ask Emergent About Conda Support ⏳

**Timeline:** Unknown (waiting for support response)

**Why this might work:**
- Emergent might have conda-enabled containers
- Could stay in current environment
- Would avoid transferring files

**What you need:**
1. Contact Emergent support
2. Ask about conda/custom Docker images
3. Wait for response
4. If available, install PyGimli

**Next Action:** Contact Emergent support with this question:
```
"I need conda-forge to install PyGimli for scientific computing.
Does Emergent support conda environments or custom Docker images
with conda pre-installed?"
```

---

### Path 3: Continue Here, Deploy Later 🔄

**Timeline:** Flexible (deploy when feature-complete)

**Why you might choose this:**
- Want to add more features first
- Not ready for deployment
- Prefer to develop more before testing with real data

**What happens:**
- Continue developing in Emergent with mock
- Add features, polish UI
- Deploy to Windows/AWS when ready

**Trade-off:** Can't verify scientific accuracy until deployment

**Next Action:** Tell me what features to add

---

## 🏆 My Recommendation

**Choose Path 1: Deploy to Windows NOW**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Fast:** Setup in 2 hours
2. **Proven:** You have conda working
3. **Validation:** Verify code works with YOUR data
4. **Development:** Continue building with real results
5. **Research:** Start using for actual work immediately

**The application is tested and ready. Moving to Windows gets you real PyGimli today, not waiting indefinitely.**

**Can you spend 2 hours today on setup?**
- ✅ Yes → Choose Path 1
- ❌ No → Choose Path 2 or 3

**Do you need real results now for research?**
- ✅ Yes → Choose Path 1 (fastest)
- ❌ No → Path 3 (continue developing)

**Are you comfortable transferring files?**
- ✅ Yes → Choose Path 1
- ❌ No → Choose Path 2 (wait for Emergent)

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### If You Choose Path 1 (Windows):

**Step 1:** Read `TRANSFER_TO_WINDOWS.md`
```
Learn how to download/transfer files from Emergent to Windows
```

**Step 2:** Transfer the application
```
Download: backend/, frontend/, and all .md files
Save to: C:\Users\YourUsername\bert-imager\
```

**Step 3:** Open `WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`
```
Follow Part 2: Setup Conda Environment
Install PyGimli
```

**Step 4:** Start developing with real PyGimli!
```
Upload your STG files
Run inversions
Get accurate results
```

---

### If You Choose Path 2 (Emergent):

**Step 1:** Contact Emergent support
```
Ask about conda or custom Docker support
```

**Step 2:** Share this info with them
```
"Need: conda-forge for PyGimli (geophysics library)
Reason: Scientific computing requirements
Alternative: Custom Docker with miniconda"
```

**Step 3:** Wait for response
```
If yes: Install PyGimli in Emergent
If no: Switch to Path 1 (Windows)
```

---

### If You Choose Path 3 (Continue Here):

**Step 1:** List priority features

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: I'm not sure which path to choose.**
**A:** Path 1 (Windows) is fastest and most reliable. Choose this unless you have a specific reason not to.

**Q: Will I lose my work moving to Windows?**
**A:** No! All files transfer. Development continues on Windows with same code.

**Q: How do I know if PyGimli is really working?**
**A:** Check `/api/versions` endpoint. Look for `"pygimli:available": true`. Also, plots will look different for different files.

**Q: Can I develop on Windows and deploy to AWS later?**
**A:** Yes! Same conda approach works everywhere. Develop on Windows, deploy anywhere.

**Q: What if I get stuck during Windows setup?**
**A:** I can help! The guides have troubleshooting sections. Also, ask me any specific questions.
