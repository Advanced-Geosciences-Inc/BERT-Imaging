# BERT 2D Imager - Complete Development Roadmap

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Backend with real PyGimli integration code
- Frontend with 4-tab interface (File I/O, QA/QC, Canvas Plots, BERT Native)
- All API endpoints functional
- STG file parsing working
- BERT plot generation confirmed
- Tested with multiple file uploads

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation:**
- Running with **mock PyGimli** in Emergent container (generates synthetic plots)
- Real PyGimli requires conda environment (not available in current container)

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Path Forward - Three Options

### Option A: Deploy to Windows 11 (Your PC) - RECOMMENDED ‚úÖ

**Why:** You have conda installed, can get real PyGimli working immediately.

**Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Transfer application to Windows (follow `TRANSFER_TO_WINDOWS.md`)
2. ‚úÖ Setup conda environment (follow `WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
3. ‚úÖ Install real PyGimli via conda-forge
4. ‚úÖ Continue development with accurate results
5. ‚úÖ Test with your real survey data

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours to setup, then continue development

**Result:** Real PyGimli working, scientifically accurate inversions

---

### Option B: Wait for Emergent Conda Support

**Why:** Stay in current Emergent environment if they add conda support.

**Steps:**
1. ‚è≥ Contact Emergent support about conda containers
2. ‚è≥ Wait for response
3. ‚è≥ If available, request conda-enabled container
4. ‚úÖ Install PyGimli in new container
5. ‚úÖ Continue development in Emergent

**Timeline:** Unknown (depends on Emergent support response)

**Result:** Could continue in Emergent with real PyGimli

---

### Option C: Continue Development in Emergent, Deploy Later

**Why:** If you want to add features before deploying with real PyGimli.

**Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Continue building features in Emergent (with mock)
2. ‚úÖ Add export functionality, advanced filters, etc.
3. ‚úÖ Polish UI/UX
4. ‚û°Ô∏è When ready, deploy to Windows/AWS with real PyGimli

**Timeline:** Flexible - deploy when feature-complete

**Result:** More features but still using mock until deployment

---

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline Estimate

### Conservative Timeline
- **Week 1:** Transfer to Windows, setup conda, validate with real data
- **Week 2:** Test with all your survey files, ensure accuracy
- **Week 3-4:** Add priority features
- **Week 5:** Polish UI/UX
- **Week 6:** Deploy to production (if needed)

### Aggressive Timeline
- **Day 1:** Transfer and setup on Windows
- **Day 2:** Validate with real data
- **Day 3-7:** Add features as needed
- **Week 2:** Production deployment

## üìû Decision Points

### Immediate Decision (Today)

**Choose your path:**
- [ ] **Option A:** Deploy to Windows now (recommended)
- [ ] **Option B:** Wait for Emergent conda support
- [ ] **Option C:** Continue in Emergent, deploy later

**My recommendation:** Option A - fastest path to real results.

### After Windows Setup (If choosing Option A)

**Validate first, then decide on features:**
1. First, verify real PyGimli works with YOUR data
2. Then, discuss what features you need
3. Prioritize based on research requirements

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can we install real PyGimli in this Emergent container?**  
A: No, PyGimli requires conda and compiled C++ libraries. This container uses pip/venv which cannot install PyGimli.

**Q: Will my code work on Windows after working here?**  
A: Yes! The code is identical. Only difference is Windows will have real PyGimli instead of mock.

**Q: How long until I can use this for real research?**  
A: If you deploy to Windows today, you can use real PyGimli tonight. Setup takes ~2 hours.

**Q: Do I lose my work if I move to Windows?**  
A: No! You transfer all files. Everything continues on Windows.

**Q: Can I come back to Emergent later?**  
A: Yes, if Emergent adds conda support or you can deploy the finished app to Emergent later.

**Q: What if I can't get conda working on Windows?**  
A: Unlikely - conda is designed for Windows. But if issues arise, we can troubleshoot or try AWS EC2 instead.
